            Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set
            of attributes and methods that the created objects can use. Classes
            encapsulate data and functions that operate on the data.

            Object: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is
            defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is
            created.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Python, when you create an instance of a class, like my_car =
            Car("Toyota", "Corolla"), the __init__ method is called with the
            newly created object passed as the first argument (self). This is
            equivalent to explicitly passing the object, as in Car(my_car,
            "Toyota", "Corolla"). The self parameter refers to the instance
            itself, allowing the __init__ method to initialize the instance's
            attributes.

                1.1 Object Creation and Initialization
              </h3>
              <p>
                In Python, the <code>__init__</code> method is not responsible
                for allocating memory for the object itself. The memory
                allocation for a new object is handled by the Python interpreter
                before the <code>__init__</code> method is called. Here's a
                breakdown of the process:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
                <li>
                  Memory Allocation: When a new instance of a class is created,
                  Python first allocates memory for the new object. This process
                  involves setting up space in memory to hold the object,
                  including its attributes.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Object Initialization (<code>__init__</code>): After memory is
                  allocated, Python calls the <code>__init__</code> method to
                  initialize the object. This method can be used to set the
                  initial state of the object, such as assigning values to its
                  attributes. The <code>__init__</code> method receives the
                  newly created object as its first argument (self), along with
                  any additional arguments passed during the object's creation.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Using the Object: Once the object is initialized, it can be
                  used according to the methods and attributes defined in its
                  class.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                It's important to note that the <code>__init__</code> method is
                not the constructor in the traditional sense, as it does not
                create the object or allocate memory. In Python, the actual
                constructor is the <code>__new__</code> method, which is called
                before <code>__init__</code> and is responsible for creating the
                new instance. However, <code>__new__</code> is usually only
                overridden in special cases, such as when creating instances of
                immutable types like integers or strings.

                1.2 Default Initialization
              </h3>
              <p>
                If you don't define an <code>__init__</code> method in a class,
                Python will use a default <code>__init__</code> method provided
                by the base object class. This default method doesn't perform
                any special initializationâ€”it simply creates the instance and
                returns it without setting any attributes.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 my-2">
                <pre>
                  <code>
                    {`class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj)`}
                  </code>
                </pre>
              </div>
              <p>Output:</p>
              <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 my-2">
                <pre>
                  <code>{`<__main__.MyClass object at 0x...>`}</code>
                </pre>
              </div>
              <p>
                In this case, the instance <code>obj</code> is created, but
                there are no attributes to initialize because we didn't define
                any in <code>MyClass</code>. The object will be created without
                any additional setup.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if your class needs to initialize specific attributes
                when an object is created, you must define an{" "}
                <code>__init__</code> method to set those attributes. Otherwise,
                the object will not have the necessary data members, which could
                lead to errors when you try to use them later.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 my-2">

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

              <p>
                In summary, the <code>__init__</code> method is not mandatory,
                but it is essential if you want to perform any initialization of
                the object's attributes. If you don't provide it, Python will
                use the default <code>__init__</code> method, which does nothing
                other than create the instance.

            Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping the data (attributes) and

            restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is

            Inheritance is a way to create a new class from an existing class.

            In Python's inheritance model, super().__init__(brand, model) is
            used to call the __init__ method of the parent class from within a
            subclass. This ensures that the parent class's initialization logic
            is executed, allowing the subclass to extend or modify it while
            preserving the setup provided by the parent class.

          <p>
            In Python, the Method Resolution Order (MRO) is crucial in multiple
            inheritance scenarios. It determines the order in which base classes
            are searched when calling a method on an instance. MRO helps ensure
            a consistent and predictable method lookup order, especially in
            complex class hierarchies.

            Key Concepts <br />
            <b>MRO Definition:</b>
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MRO is the order in which
            classes are searched when a method is called on an instance.
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python uses the C3 linearization
            algorithm to compute the MRO, which combines depth-first and
            breadth-first approaches to ensure a consistent and well-defined
            order.
            <br /> <b>C3 Linearization: </b>
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Python uses C3 linearization to
            compute the MRO, which considers the order of base classes and
            ensures that the method resolution follows a specific path.
            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This algorithm handles
            multiple inheritance by creating a linear hierarchy that maintains
            the order of base classes and respects their relationships.

                        D (class of the instance)
                        B (first base class listed in the MRO)
                        C (next base class)
                        A (last base class)
                        object (base class for all new-style classes)

                    Output :
                    (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)
                    Since B appears before C in the MRO, the method() from class B is called. The output will be:
                    Method in class B

          <p>
            The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it
            refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be
            executed on many objects or classes.
          </p>{" "}
          <br />
          <p>
            Polymorphism is a feature in programming that allows different
            classes to be used interchangeably. It means that even if different
            objects belong to different classes, they can be used in the same
            way if they share a common method or interface.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, if different classes like Dog, Cat, and Bird all have a
            method named speak(), you can call speak() on an object of any of
            these classes, and it will work, even though each class has its own
            version of speak(). This makes it easy to write code that works with
            different types of objects in a flexible way.
            <br />
            In simpler terms, polymorphism lets you use different things in the
            same way.

      title: "Abstraction",

          <p>
            Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation
            details and showing only the essential features of an object. It is
            achieved using abstract classes and interfaces in Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            Abstract Classes: A class that cannot be instantiated and is often
            used to define a common interface for its subclasses.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In simple terms, an interface in programming is like a contract or a
            blueprint that defines a set of methods that a class must implement.
            It doesn't contain the actual code for these methods; instead, it
            just specifies what methods should be present.
            <br />
            Think of it like a list of things a class should be able to do, but
            without saying how to do them. The actual implementation (how the
            methods work) is left up to the class that implements the interface.
            <br />
            <br />
            In Python, we don't have interfaces in the same way as in some other
            programming languages, but we can use abstract base classes (ABCs)
            to achieve a similar effect. ABCs can define methods that must be
            implemented by any subclass. <br />
            Python's abc module allows you to define abstract base classes. An
            abstract base class can define a set of methods that must be
            implemented by any subclass.
